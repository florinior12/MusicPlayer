# MusicPlayer
This app is a project which I have made for the Android Programming optional course at my university.
It's a simple app, which reads the mp3 files from the phone's external storage, plays them, displays their lyrics and the album art.

The lyrics display was initially made using an external API but I had to give up on that one.

In the end I have just web scraped from an website whose URL links followed a well defined pattern for song names and artist.
